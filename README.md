# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors
This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors related to the CSS `calc()` function:

1. **Incorrect usage within flexbox:**  `calc()` behaves differently within flexbox items compared to block-level elements.  Incorrect usage can lead to unexpected sizing and layout issues.
2. **Operator precedence:**  Incorrect operator precedence within the `calc()` expression can produce unexpected results due to the order of operations.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  See the code comments for details.
