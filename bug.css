The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox item might not work as expected because flexbox items don't respect `calc()` in the same way as block-level elements.  Another issue is incorrect operator precedence within `calc()`. For example, `calc(20% + 10px * 2)` will not produce the expected result due to the multiplication happening before the addition.
